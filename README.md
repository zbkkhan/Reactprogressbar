# AlbumArtBackground #

### What will this project do? ###
given a link/url to an image (album art image), display it with extreme blur and zoom (so the image isn't identifiable but you can see the blurred colours as a background). It'll act as a visualization while a song is playing.

### What's one way to accomplish this? ###
Extreme blurring with css or a transparent image with a blur hovering over the album art image. Then think up the logic and code your own custom effects (zoom and pan, fade, etc.) using jQuery.

### Things you might need to use to make this work: ###
* CSS & CSS3 animations and effects
* jQuery
